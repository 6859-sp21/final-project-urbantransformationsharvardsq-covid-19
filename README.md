ABSTRACT
The paper studies how the different phases of the pandemic along with the restrictions were affecting the walking experience over the period of three months. The paper proposes a computational model to understanding and representing the temporal changes in the urban experience through sound. A novel system of representation is constructed in the form of a notational system along with a interactive interface as a tool for encoding temporal changes into visual encodings enabling the comparison between different walking experiences. 
Keywords: Urban Transformations, walking experience, soundscape, COVID-19.
